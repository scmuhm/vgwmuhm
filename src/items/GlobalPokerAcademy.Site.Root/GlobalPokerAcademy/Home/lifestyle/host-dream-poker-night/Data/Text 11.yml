      Value: <h2>10. Just Have Fun With It</h2><p>No matter how much you plan and prepare, something will go wrong; it's inevitable when a group of people get together. You might run out of drinks, the pizza might be cold, a chair might break, or someone might try to enact an obscure rule nobody has ever heard of. Don't stress; just enjoy the game you have built and be a courteous host.</p>
