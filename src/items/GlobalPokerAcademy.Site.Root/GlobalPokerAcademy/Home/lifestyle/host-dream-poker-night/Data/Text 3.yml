      Value: "<h2>2. Pick a Good Table</h2><p>Most people don't have a purpose-built poker table sitting around, so it falls on a regular household table to fulfil the job for the game. It should be able to seat between 6 and 10 players comfortably. Less than 6 players and the game often stalls, any more than 10 and you'll spend half the night playing one hand. Space is also an issue; you want everybody to be able to sit at the table without bumping into each other.</p><p>If more than 10 players commit to the game, you’ll need a second table, as a minimum, have 6 per table. Regardless of how many people you’re expecting, it would be best if you planned for a few extras; there is always that one person who brings a friend or two. It’s better to have too many rather than not enough.</p><p>Chairs are another consideration, make sure to have enough chairs for every one of your guests, then have a few extras at the ready for an emergency and interlopers. If you’re desperate, make the event BYOC – Bring Your Own Chair. Rather than make it seem like something you should apologize for (I mean, who really has 15 chairs laying around their house?), make a feature of it and award a prize for the best chair.</p>"
