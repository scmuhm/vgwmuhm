      Value: "<h2>5. Outline the Rules Before Play Starts</h2><p>Set out the rules of the poker game early to avoid disputes later. Unfortunately, if money is involved, arguments can and will happen, no matter how friendly everyone is at the start. Outlining rules such as if there are rebuys, what happens in the event of a draw and what happens to someone’s power hand if they are out on smoke break or in the bathroom when the cards are dealt, will ensure it doesn't fall on you as the host to play referee and settle disputes. Bear in mind no matter how well you organize things and tell people how things will run, you’ll probably need to do a little bit of ‘conflict resolution’ of some sort during the night, whether it’s because someone’s chair breaks or because they show signs of tilt. It’s part of running the night and don’t worry, it’ll all work out in the end!</p><p>If one decision becomes particularly divisive, take it to a vote and stick by the result, consistency is key. Once you've created the event page, it is also a good idea to post the set rules and a PDF on how to play poker. Most reasonable people will be happy to help newer players, we were all beginners once, but it’ll make life much easier if the new people at least have a bit of an idea how to play poker.</p>"
