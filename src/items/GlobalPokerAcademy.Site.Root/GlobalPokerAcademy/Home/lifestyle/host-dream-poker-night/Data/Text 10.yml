      Value: <h2>9. Get Creative</h2><p>Once you've got all the main preparations out of the way, look for ways to add a bit more fun to the game. A belt from a discount store modified to say “Po er Champion,” a trophy for the overall winner of the tournament, or the person with the most cash at the end of the game isn't essential, but will add a bit more enjoyment. There are many different ways to modify the game to add more fun; the only limit is your imagination, and maybe your budget.</p>
