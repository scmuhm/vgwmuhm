      Value: "<h2>6. Food</h2><p>If you’re planning to supply some food, get plenty of snacks, chips, nuts, cookies and if you’re feeling generous, dips. If the game is going to go for a few hours, it might be appropriate to feed everyone something substantial – pizza, burgers or some kind of fast food is usually the easiest. Drinks are also a necessity, alcoholic and non-alcoholic. If money is tight, ask everyone to bring a plate to share, and their own beverages.</p>"
